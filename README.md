>**Bike Share Data**: Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project uses data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. It allows to compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The code provides the following information:
  1. **Popular times of travel** (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
    * most common month
    * most common day of week
    * most common hour of day
  2. **Popular stations and trip**
    * most common start station
    * most common end station
    * most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
  3. **Trip duration**
    * total travel time
    * average travel time
  4. **User info**
    * counts of each user type
    * counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    * earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
    * chicago.csv
    * new_york_city.csv
    * washington.csv
